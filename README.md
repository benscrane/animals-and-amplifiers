# Animals and Amplifers

## Getting Setup

### Initial Setup - One time only

1. [Install Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v1/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
2. From the command line, clone this repo by typing `git clone https://github.com/benscrane/animals-and-amplifiers.git`

### Ongoing Steps - Run each time you're publishing

1. Pull new changes from the public repo - `git pull`
2. Create a new Markdown file in the /src/blog folder. The filename will become the URL for the blog post so it should be similar to the title of the post and convey meaning, use words separated by hyphens (e.g. the-impact-of-hammers.md).
3. Copy the contents of /src/blog/TEMPLATE.md into your empty Markdown file.  Update the title, publish date, author, and excerpt.
4. When you're done, save the file.
5. From the terminal, add your changes to the local git repo - `git add .`
6. Commit your changes to the local repo, replace "Your message here" with a message like "adding the-impact-of-hammers" - `git commit -m "Your message here"`
7. Push your changes from the public repo, you'll need to enter your GitHub email and password - `git push`
